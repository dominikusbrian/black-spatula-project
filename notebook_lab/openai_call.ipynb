      "- **Paragraph:** \"Estimation of exposure to BDE-209 from contaminated kitchen utensils indicated users would have a median intake of 34,700 ng/day, exceeding estimates for intake from dust and diet. The detection of FRs in collected household products indicates that recycling, without the necessary transparency and restrictions to ensure safety, is resulting in unexpected exposure to toxic flame retardants in household items.\"\n",
      "- **Specific Statement:** \"... and would approach the U.S. BDE-209 reference dose of 7000 ng/kg bw/day (42,000 ng/day for a 60 kg adult).\"\n",

The RfD is an estimate of a daily exposure level for humans that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1.2 Authors' Arithmetic and Reasoning:**\n",
      "- The U.S. EPA RfD for BDE-209 is stated as **7000 ng/kg body weight/day**.\n",

      "- This correction does not diminish the significance of their findings regarding potential exposure from contaminated household items but ensures accuracy in the presentation and interpretation of the data.\n"

The text highlights the high levels of FRs found in household products, emphasizing the need for regulatory systems to ensure safer materials. The conclusion section states the importance of eliminating toxic additives in recycled plastic products and mentions the role of authors in producing the document.
